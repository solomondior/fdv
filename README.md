## Widgets and Bots

This repo contains both 'read-only' widgets (boards, KPIs) and 'active' bots (that can trade). If you enable trading bots, use a burner wallet and keep balances small.

### Auto Tools Panel (Trader / Sentry / Hold / Follow)

Implementation entrypoint: `src/vista/widgets/auto/index.js`

The Auto Tools Panel is a tabbed automation suite. These tools share common utilities:

- Adaptive RPC backoff/throttling
- Backoff-aware slippage adjustments and retry logic
- Safety checks around dust/min-notional and route cooldowns

#### Trader (Auto)

Best for: hands-off position management with guardrails.

- Auto wallet mode with local keypair (quick copy/export)
- Automated buy/sell policy set (take-profit, stop-loss, trailing stop, partials)
- Cooldowns and reconciliation logic to reduce 'double spend / stale state' issues
- Fallback sell flow: split sizing, higher slippage re-quotes, bridge paths, manual send paths
- Reserve management (fee/rent/runway buffers) and ATA rent estimation per swap

#### Sentry (Sniper)

Best for: signal-driven entries based on KPIs and short-term momentum.

- Scans top candidates and rotates into the strongest setups
- Flame mode can track the current Flamebar leader with rotation/cooldown rules
- Momentum guards and rug gating to reduce bad fills on unstable tokens

#### Hold

Best for: 'I want to watch/hold *this specific mint* and auto-manage a basic exit.'

- Up to 3 concurrent hold tabs (persisted)
- Open a mint directly from token cards and from the Flamebar 'HODL' button
- Config options (varies by mode): poll interval, buy %, profit %, rug severity threshold, repeat buys, 'uptick-only' gating
- Exit logic includes profit targets plus a 'PnL fade' style exit (when green peaks then fades)
- Dynamic slippage that increases under RPC backoff and on rug/severity events

#### Follow

Best for: mirroring a target wallet using your Auto wallet.

- Watches a target wallet and mirrors buys with configurable sizing
- Designed to reuse the Auto wallet secret (headless-friendly)

### Flamebar (Top PnL Leader)

Implementation: `src/vista/widgets/auto/lib/flamebar.js`

- Tracks a rolling performance window (default ~15m)
- Selects a leader and prefers 'active pumps' (recent positive momentum)
- Adds a 'hot' highlight for outsized PnL
- Provides a one-click path into Hold via the 'HODL' action

### Swap Modal

Implementation: `src/vista/widgets/swap/index.js`

- Phantom connect
- Quote preview (estimated output, min received, route hops)
- Slippage stepper and sanity checks
- Mobile deep-link to jup.ag with desktop fallbacks
- Throttles/pause hooks to keep the live UI responsive while open

### Favorites Board

Implementation: `src/vista/widgets/favboard/index.js`

- Cached leaderboard + token metadata enrichment
- Responsive layout (table on desktop, cards on mobile)
- Quick links to token pages and live stats

---

## Use Cases (Playbooks)

- Discover: use the main radar + KPIs to shortlist, then open token pages for confirmation.
- Track a runner: watch Flamebar and open Hold for the leader to manage a lightweight plan.
- Mirror a wallet: use Follow with a small buy percentage and strict max-hold.
- Signal-driven entries: use Sentry for short-term setups and rotate based on momentum.

---

## Custom KPIs (Hand-Written)

### Pumping Radar (PUMP)

Implementation: `src/vista/meme/metrics/kpi/pumping.js`

- Short lookback with fast decay for immediacy
- Hard gates: minimum liquidity, minimum volume, price sanity
- Acceleration signals (short-to-long window transitions)
- Badge system: Pumping / Warming / Calm

### DEGEN Bottom Sniper (DEGEN)

Implementation: `src/vista/meme/metrics/kpi/degen.js`

- Trailing multi-day history with decay and per-mint caps
- Gates: minimum liquidity/volume, price sanity
- Recency-weighted stats and bounce-from-lows detection
- Highlights coins recovering from deep pullbacks with improving volume

---

## Data Engine

- Streaming pipeline: `src/engine/pipeline.js`
  - Ingests multiple feeds with windowed keyword scanning
  - TokenStore for stable, NaN-safe merges; MarqueeStore for trending/new
  - Scoring + recommendations with guarded 'measured-only' emission
  - Adaptive stream pause/resume hooks for UI (swap modal, etc.)
  - Ad loader + deterministic selection

---

## Trading Safeguards (Applies to the Bots)

- Min order sizing: Jupiter min-in and minimum sell-notional enforcement
- Fee/rent/runway reserves; ATA rent estimation per route
- Pending credit watcher + cache-first reconciliation patterns
- Router cooldowns on dust/no-route errors (per mint)
- Sell fallbacks: split sizing, slippage bumps, bridge paths, manual send paths
- Dust-exit controls (when enabled) with user-defined minimum output

---

## Quick Start

- Serve statically (any static host or simple file server)
- Open the app and set a CORS-enabled Solana RPC (optional headers supported)
- If using bots: generate an Auto wallet and fund it with a small amount of SOL
- Start with conservative sizing and higher slippage caps until you trust your RPC

---

## Dev CLI (Auto Trader)

- Validate urgent/hard-exit router cooldown bypass:
  - `node tools/trader.mjs --validate-sell-bypass`

- Dry-run sell evaluation from a snapshot (no RPC, no swaps):
  - `node tools/trader.mjs --dry-run-sell --snapshot tools/snapshots/sample-sell.json`
  - Snapshot notes:
    - Required: `mint`, `pos.sizeUi`, `pos.costSol`
    - Provide either `curSol` or `pxNow` (valuation input)
    - Optional: `state.takeProfitPct` / `state.stopLossPct` / `state.trailPct` for TP/SL/trailing
    - Optional: `urgent` + `routerHoldUntil` to test urgent sells under router hold

- Deterministic sim against the real auto-bot module (RPC/wallet/quotes stubbed):
  - `node tools/trader.mjs --sim-index`
  - Optional: `--steps 40 --dt-ms 1000 --throw-prune --debug-sell`

- Run the real auto-bot headlessly using a named profile:
  - Recommended (direct-link, single profile JSON):
    - `node cli.mjs --run-profile --profile-url <httpsUrl> [--log-to-console]`
    - Example: `node cli.mjs --run-profile --profile-url https://fdv.lol/tools/profiles/fdv.profiles.example.json --log-to-console`
  - Advanced (multi-profile doc):
    - `node cli.mjs --run-profile --profiles <pathOrUrl> --profile <name> [--log-to-console]`

### Headless follow (via `--run-profile`)

`--run-profile` can run **Auto** and **Follow** together from a *single* profile.

Common/shared keys (top-level inside your chosen profile):
- `rpcUrl` (or `rpc.url`): Solana RPC endpoint.
- `rpcHeaders` (or `rpc.headers`): Object of headers for your RPC.
- `autoWalletSecret` (or `wallet.secret`) (required for headless bots that sign): Auto wallet secret used for signing swaps.
  - Accepts either a base58 secret, or a JSON array string like `[12,34,...]`.
- `recipientPub` (or `wallet.recipientPub`) (optional): where “return SOL” features send SOL.
- `jupApiKey` (or `jupiter.apiKey`) (recommended): Jupiter API key used for quotes/swaps.
- `agentGaryFullAi` (or `agent`/`llm`) (optional): Agent Gary runtime config (model/provider/key/risk/fullAiControl).

Enable/disable rules:
- Auto runs by default unless you set `"auto": false`.
- Follow runs when `follow` is an object and `follow.enabled !== false`.

Follow config (profile key: `follow`):
- `enabled`: `true/false` (default: enabled if present)
- `targetWallet` (required): wallet address to follow
- `buyPct` (optional): percent of auto wallet SOL to use per mirrored buy (range clamps to 10–70)
- `maxHoldMin` (optional): max minutes to hold before exiting
- `pollMs` (optional): polling interval (min 250ms)

Example profiles file:
- See `tools/profiles/fdv.profiles.example.json` for a minimal single-profile starting point.

Example commands:
- Follow-only (profile must set `"auto": false` and enable follow):
  - `node cli.mjs --run-profile --profiles tools/profiles/dev.json --profile follow_only --log-to-console`
- Auto + Follow:
  - `node cli.mjs --run-profile --profiles tools/profiles/dev.json --profile all_bots --log-to-console`

- Help:
  - `node tools/trader.mjs --help`

fix(trader): correct partial-sell cost basis to prevent inflated PnL after exits; unmount hold giscus on profile navigation and remount only on active user intent.
